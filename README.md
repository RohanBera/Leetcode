# LeetCode 

- LeetCoding challenge 2021
- Didn't want to make this repo public, but it'll probably guilt me into leetcod-ing regularly, so eh, might as well make a nice README.
- Collapsable markdown?? Nice.

<summary style="font-size:18px"> <b>Day 1</b> - Number of 1 Bits </summary>
A function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Eg - <br />

1. 
    * **Input**: 11
    * **Output**: 3
    * **Explaination**: The input 11 (binary string  0000000000000000000000000001011) has a total of three '1' bits.

2. 
    * **Input**: 32
    * **Output**: 1
    * **Explaination**: The input 32 (binary string  0000000000000000000000000100000) has a total of 1 '1' bit.

<summary style="font-size:18px"> <b>Day 2</b> - Trimming a binary tree </summary>

Given the <mark>root</mark> of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as <mark>low</mark> and <mark>high</mark>, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in <mark>[low, high]</mark>. Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a unique answer.

Eg - <br />

1. 
   * **Input**: root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2
   * **Output**: [1,null,2]

2. 
   * **Input**: root = [3,0,4,null,2,null,null,1], low = 1, high = 3
   * **Output**: [3,2,null,1]

3. 
   * **Input**: root = [1,null,2], low = 1, high = 3
   * **Output**: [1,null,2]
