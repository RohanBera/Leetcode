# LeetCode 

- Leetcode Daily, weekly and bi-weekly challenges 
- Didn't want to make this repo public, but it'll probably guilt me into leetcod-ing regularly, so eh, might as well make a nice README.
- Collapsable markdown?? Nice.
- No support for css, but has emojis :expressionless:. Great.

   ### Trimming a binary tree 

   Given the `root` of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as `low` and `high`, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in `[low, high]`. Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a unique answer.

   ### Trimming a binary tree 

   Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

   There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

   ### Longest Harmonious Subsequence

   We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly** 1.

   Given an integer array `nums`, return the *length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences*.

   A **subsequence** of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

   ### Simplify Path

   Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

   - `'.'` : current directory 
   - `'..'`: refers to the directory up a level
   - `'//'`: treated as a single slash '/'
   - `'...'`: any other format of periods are treated as file/directory names.

   *Return the simplified **canonical path**.*

   ### Binary Tree Right Side View

   Given a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.
