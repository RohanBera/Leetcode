# LeetCode 

- Leetcode Daily, weekly and bi-weekly challenges 
- Didn't want to make this repo public, but it'll probably guilt me into leetcod-ing regularly, so eh, might as well make a nice README.
- Collapsable markdown?? Nice.
- No support for css, but has emojis :expressionless:. Great.

      ### 669. Trimming a binary tree 

      Given the `root` of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as `low` and `high`, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in `[low, high]`. Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a unique answer.

      ### 141. Linked List Cycle

      Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

      There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

      ### 594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence
      We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly** 1.

      Given an integer array `nums`, return the *length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences*.

      A **subsequence** of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

      ### 71. Simplify Path
      Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

      - `'.'` : current directory 
      - `'..'`: refers to the directory up a level
      - `'//'`: treated as a single slash '/'
      - `'...'`: any other format of periods are treated as file/directory names.

      *Return the simplified **canonical path**.*

      ### 1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated

      Given an array `nums`, return `true` if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return `false`.

      There may be **duplicates** in the original array.

      Note: An array `A` rotated by `x` positions results in an array `B` of the same length such that `A[i] == B[(i+x) % A.length]`, where % is the modulo operation.

      ### 1753. Maximum Score From Removing Stones

      **Time limit exceeded**

      You are playing a solitaire game with three piles of stones of sizes `a`, `b`, and 'c' respectively. Each turn you choose two different non-empty piles, take one stone from each, and add 1 point to your score. The game stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there are no more available moves).

      Given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the maximum score you can get.

      **Didnt do**

      You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `goal`.

      You want to choose a subsequence of `nums` such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to `goal`. That is, if the `sum` of the subsequence's elements is sum, then you want to minimize the absolute difference `abs(sum - goal)`.

      Return the minimum possible value of `abs(sum - goal)`.
