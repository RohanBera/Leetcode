### Day 1 - Number of 1 Bits

A function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Eg -
1. 
    * **Input**: 11
    * **Output**: 3
    * **Explaination**: The input 11 (binary string  0000000000000000000000000001011) has a total of three '1' bits.

2. 
    * **Input**: 32
    * **Output**: 1
    * **Explaination**: The input 32 (binary string  0000000000000000000000000100000) has a total of 1 '1' bit.
